Thanks for choosing BoloDay, a hot responsive theme for content lovers.
Here's a quick heads up on how things work.

-------------------------------------------
Feature Slider 
-------------------------------------------
You can set up the feature slider under Appearance > Theme Options.
"Tag for featured posts" lets you choose a specific tag for posts that will be appearing in the slider. After choosing a tag here, add that tag to all of the posts you want to be featured. Default is "feature"

"Featured Post Limit" lets you limit the number of posts in the slider. Default is 5.

-------------------------------------------
Color Schemes
-------------------------------------------
To change the themes colorscheme, simply go to Appearance > Theme Options and choose a color scheme from the "Style" Dropdown. Currently available color schemes are: Blue, Orange, Dark, Green and Default (a somewhat darker version of blue).
